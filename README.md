## New-contributors

This README is designed to be beginner-friendly so anyone can contribute.

Syntax is not very strict and will likely be corrected when code or issues are reviewed.

It's recommended to have some experience with either Django or vanilla front-end web development before working on this project.

&nbsp;

## Reporting bugs

Navigate to the *Issues* tab at the top and create a new issue.

Make sure you put `[BUG]` at the beginning of your title.

Make a descriptive but concise title and write a brief couple sentences about a bug you found.
When you're done, just submit. 

After a bug is submited, you can track our progress and make sure everything is fixed.

## Suggesting features

Navigate to the *Issues* tab at the top and create a new issue.

Make sure you put `[SUGGESTION]` at the beginning of your title.

Make a descriptive but concise title and write a brief couple sentences about your suggestion.
When you're done, just submit. 

After a suggestion is submited, you can track out progress and see your idea come to life!

### Development

This is the full code of the Django app (except the actual secret key, which is replaced by a django default).

Running this app requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and a few libraries.

In the environment you would like to work in, run the following commands:
```
pip install Django
pip install django-allauth
```

Run this to set up the local database:
```
python manage.py migrate
```

Now, you need to create a local superuser.
Note that these credentials are stored locally so they don't need to be particularly secure.
Run the following command and follow the instructions:
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Start the local server with this command:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

Open your web browser and go to `https://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`.
This should open the login to the admin site.
Use your credentials from before the log in.

Now, navigate to `Social applications` on the left menu and add your Google OAuth credentials (Just client ID and client secret).
If you don't have these credentials yet, check out [this help page](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en) to get them.

Once you're done with the admin page, you must log out with the link in the top right.

Now, go to `https://127.0.0.1:8080/setsample/`.
You should be prompted to sign in with Google.
If the page says `Good`, your dev environment is all set up!

&nbsp;

### Implementation

This app is implemented with a vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS frontend with a Django backend and Postgres database, all hosted on Heroku.

`tuesapp` is the actual app and `landing` is the landing page. The following details are about `tuesapp`:

The frontend is templated HTML, with one template for each page and a central base template with nav items.

The CSS and JS are split similarly, with a few central files and various other files for each page.

The landing page is not yet implemented, but will be done with static HTML, CSS, and JS.

### Pull requests

The title of a pull request should briefly describe your changes at a high level.
If you added a button in the dashboard, just put `Added a {name} button to dashboard`

The description of a pull request should explain why something was added, removed, or changed.
This time, you can include any other information you think necessary.

If your pull request addresses an issue, be sure to provide a link to the issue in the pull request.

Sometimes, your pull request may not be up to our standards.
Don't worry, we will always explain what was wrong and how it can be fixed.
You can always submit another pull request
